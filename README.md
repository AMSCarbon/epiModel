# epiModel

Revisiting my old TB model to code it better and answer a different issue.

When Covid hit last year, i was inspiried to start a new, more generalised epidemic model. 

I was interested in the idea of how the influenza virus would evolve in different, isolated populations. 

With Australia being almost entirely closed off to the rest of the world, I was wondering if our Influenza would evolve differently, to strains in America or Europe, 
and what that would mean when the world opened up again.
